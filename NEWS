## acidplots 0.2.0 (2019-04-20)

Reworked package, consolidating previous minimalism and firestarter packages.

### New functions

- `synesthesia` color palette functions.
- `acid_coord_flip`: Intelligently puts samples at the top of the Y axis when
  flipped. Particularly useful for barplots.
- `acid_pretty_breaks`: Attempt to improve `scales::pretty_breaks`, using an
  approach more similar to the base plot engine.
- Renamed ggplot2 themes: `acid_theme_light`, `acid_theme_dark`.

### Major changes

- All ggplot2 geoms and transformations (`ggproto` functions) now consistently
  use `acid_` as a prefix.

### Minor changes

- `plotCountsPerBiotype` and `plotCountsPerBroadClass` now support `title`.

### Deprecations

- `plotCountsPerGene` has been renamed to `plotCountsPerFeature`.
- `plotGenesDetected` has been renamed to `plotFeaturesDetected`.
- Deprecated `theme_paperwhite` and `theme_midnight` in favor of
  `acid_theme_light` and `acid_theme_dark`.

  plotting engine. Derived from a Stack Overflow post (see documentation).

  log10 counts by default.
