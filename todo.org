* Development
** TODO Create a plot for log2 vs. log2 expression of RNA-seq counts.
** TODO Consider making the theme_acid_plots less bold by default.
** TODO Rework heatmap engine to use ComplexHeatmap instead of pheatmap.
** TODO Improve passthrough argument documentation for `plotCorrelationHeatmap`
        and other heatmap functions that inherit from `plotHeatmap`.
** TODO pkgdown now seems to be failing on this, with R 4.0.4.
** TODO Need to add improved support for X-Y scatterplot with correlation
        information on the plot.
