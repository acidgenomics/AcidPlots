* Development
** TODO Check that plotQC SCE method returns interestingGroups in plot legend correctly.
** TODO Need to think about NA gene symbol handling in call to convertGenesToSymbols.
** TODO Harden plotCounts to error faster on gene identifier mismatch.
** TODO Consider adding assay support to plotCountsPerCell.
** TODO May want to harden plotCounts against DESeqDataSet input.
    We don't want to ever plot non-normalized counts by default.
** TODO Rework heatmap engine to use ComplexHeatmap instead of pheatmap.
** TODO How to suppress joint bandwidth message for ridgeline?
** TODO Consider making the theme_acid_plots less bold by default.
** TODO Create a plot for log2 vs. log2 expression of RNA-seq counts.
** TODO Improve passthrough argument documentation for `plotCorrelationHeatmap`
        and other heatmap functions that inherit from `plotHeatmap`.
** TODO Need to add improved support for X-Y scatterplot with correlation
        information on the plot.
** TODO colors: colorscope, dracula, craylola
** TODO GSEA heatmap code (put this in pfgsea).
** TODO plotHeatmap needs include basic matrix method.
** TODO Add venn diagram support? See ggVennDiagram.
    Kind of like upset plots more.
** TODO Consider adding matrix support for plotHeatmap.
    Note that this won't include interesting groups.
** TODO Add support for multiple PCs in `plotPCA()`.
    Currently `plotPCA()` functions simply to plot PC1 vs. PC2. It is useful to visualize the other components in a series (e.g. PC3 vs. PC4 in addition), which isn't currently supported in the function. We may want to add an option to display a plot grid of PC1 through PC10.
** TODO Consider switching heatmap engine.
    Switch pheatmap to ComplexHeatmap or heatmap.2?
** TODO `plotHeatmap()`: Look into kmeans approach with `kmeans_k`.
** TODO Is plotCountsCorrelation not matching geneID to geneName?
